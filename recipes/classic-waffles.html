        <h3>The Secret To Successful Waffles</h3>
        <p>Are you ready for the secret trick that makes these waffles the absolute BEST?!</p>    
        <p><em><strong>Warm Milk.</strong></em></p>
        <p>
            Yup, that’s it! And here’s why – the warm milk allows the melted butter to stay in a liquid, 
            without seizing up and clumping. This means the butter is woven beautifully through each and every waffle, 
            every little waffle pocket and you can really taste it!
            To warm the milk, I simply measure it out into a microwaveable measuring cup and heat 
            it in the microwave for just 1 minute. You don’t want it hot, just warm.
